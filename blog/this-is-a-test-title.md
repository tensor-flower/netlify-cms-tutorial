Alex Jones is an American radio show host and conspiracy theorist. In Aug 2018, Jones was removed from itunes podcast directory. Facebook, spotify and youtube also took immediate action. This sparked huge controversy. People on one side of the cultural divide believe private corporations have the right to kick people out of their platforms and social media companies are similar to publishers in that they are responsible for their content. They may or may not agree with policing hate speech, but they do agree inciting abuse against people which transforms into real life harassment and threat is off limits. Specifically, Jones spread misinformation that Sandy Hook parents were crisis actors in a government conspiracy to take away people’s guns. A Jones devotee Lucy Richards was sentenced to five months in prison for threatening the life of Leonard Pozner, whose 6-year-old son was killed in Sandy Hook shooting.

The first [video](https://www.infowars.com/cnn-lies-about-banned-infowars-videos-in-new-censorship-attempt/#2) is titled “How To Prevent Liberalism - A Public Service Announcement“, that shows a boy being thrown to the ground by a grown man and crying. Info wars argued "it is a humorous commentary on how cry-bullies on the left constantly claim to be the victims while violently attacking other people". The video was meant to trigger and mock liberal snowflakes. However, twitter viewed it as child endangerment because the man shoved the boy to the ground and the boy was clearly in pain. It assumes Jones wishes harm for the child and others. It is fascinating to see the cultural divide through this video alone. One side sees the symbolism, the other side sees the literal.
